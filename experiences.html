                In this role, I leveraged large language models (LLMs) for the generation of datasets 
                that can then be used for AI alignment purposes. Specifically, this data generation will facilitate
                scalable oversight methods, and can help train and assess critique models. In collaboration with other members
                of the research team, we created a collection of these datasets.

                In this role, I worked to help students debug their weekly coding assignments for around 4 hours per week. 
                I guide the students to finding the bugs themselves through a myriad of debugging techniques.
                Additionally, I also assisted the head TAs with interviewing new TAs for the program.

                In this role, I developed a chatbot feature onto Lambent Data's flagship product intended for both 
                patients and healthcare practicioners. Additionally, I also fine-tuned the chatbot with data that was also 
                generated through leveraging OpenAI's GPT models. Through this fine-tuning process, the chatbot was able to
                provide location-specific resources for its users. Ultimately, this product helped to drive 
                user-engagement with the site.
