                In learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed this personal website to act as a portfolio for my work 
                and an interactive resume of sorts. Through this project, I gained essential foundational knowledge of website 
                design and organization, as well as competency in the aforementioned langauges.

                This chatbot was developed as part of my internship with Lambent Data. This chatbot is based on OpenAI's GPT 
                models, and was then fine-tuned in order to provide location-specific resources for patients and community healthcare
                providers. In developing this project, I learnt more about fine-tuning AI models and the challenges that it accompanies.

                This project is currently under development by my team and I. The intended product is a graphical interface in 
                which department administrators can use to update complex graduation requirements. This tool will also be able 
                to export the graduation requirements in a YAML file that can then be used to create an interactive graduation 
                checklist for students to keep track of their degree progress. We also plan to create a suggestion tool for students
                that will be able to suggest potential majors and minors based on courses already completed. Through this project,
                I hope to strengthen my web application skills, as well as become acquainted with database management.

                This file-tree manager system was created in C through a file-directory tree-based data structure.
                Users are able to add and remove files and directories, as well as change the content of files
                through the command-line. Additionall, I also collaborated to create internal validation module for 
                the file tree in order to ensure that invariants are maintained.

                This project involved a graphical interface that provides suggestions to users' inputs. In this, 
                the users can make queries that would then be "auto-completed". This project involved maintenance of
                basic data structures and made use of a modified binary search to be able to execute in real-time
